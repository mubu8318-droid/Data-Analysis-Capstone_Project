# Data-Analysis-Capstone_Project
Analysis of Agricultural Commodity Prices Across Indian Markets

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on agricultural commodity price data collected from various markets across India. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and insights that can help understand how commodity prices vary across regions and time. The dataset represents real-world agricultural records, making this project valuable for identifying pricing behavior, seasonal influences, demand–supply factors, and market volatility.

🎯 Key Objectives

🧹 Clean and preprocess the dataset

📊 Explore market-wise and commodity-wise pricing differences

📈 Identify seasonal or regional trends

🔍 Detect anomalies and missing values

📉 Visualize findings using plots and statistical summaries
